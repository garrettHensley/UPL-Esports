      <em>
        A collaboration between legendary card game designer Richard Garfield
        and Valve, Artifact is a digital card game that combines
        deeply-strategic, competitive gameplay with the rich setting of Dota 2.
        The result is an immersive and visually-stunning trading card game
        unlike any other.

        by a series of month long leagues.
